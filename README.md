# Three.js Educational Hub

Welcome to the **Three.js Educational Hub**! This repository is dedicated to hosting educational content and projects built with Three.js. Whether you're learning the basics or showcasing your advanced Three.js projects, this is the place to collaborate, contribute, and get inspired!

## What is Three.js?

[**Three.js**](https://threejs.org/) is a **cross-browser JavaScript library** and **Application Programming Interface (API)** used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. It is built on top of WebGL, which provides powerful hardware-accelerated 3D rendering. 

Three.js makes it easy for developers to create rich, interactive 3D experiences directly in a web browser, without needing in-depth knowledge of WebGL.

### Features of Three.js:
- **Scene Graph**: Three.js provides a way to easily manage objects in a 3D scene, such as lights, cameras, and meshes.
- **Built-in Geometries**: You can easily create spheres, cubes, planes, and other basic geometries.
- **Materials and Shaders**: Three.js supports a wide range of material types (basic, phong, lambert, etc.) and lets you create custom shaders using GLSL.
- **Animation and Physics**: Animate your objects and bring them to life with built-in support for animation and basic physics interactions.
- **Lighting Models**: Three.js supports different types of lights such as ambient, point, directional, and spotlights.
- **Customizable Camera Views**: Use perspectives, orthographic cameras, and even custom controls.

## Three.js Basic Structure

A simple Three.js project consists of the following elements:

1. **Scene**: The container that holds all the 3D objects, lights, and cameras.
2. **Camera**: Determines what part of the scene is visible on the screen.
3. **Renderer**: Renders the scene onto a canvas using WebGL.
4. **Objects**: Meshes, geometries, and materials that represent 3D objects in your scene.
